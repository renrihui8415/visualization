# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Data Visualization Ethics

### Requirements:
- Letâ€™s return to the data visualizations we evaluated for Assignment 2.  

<img src="./Seeking_Safety_European_Asylum_Application_Flows.png" alt="Good" width="450" height="600"/>   <img src="./Foreigners_in_Milan.jpg" alt="Bad" width="500" height="600"/>

- For each visualization: 
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) whether or not you think this data visualization is accessible, reproducible, and equitable. 
        ```
      1. Good Visualization: Seeking Safety - European Asylum Application Flows
        Link: [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2015/05/12/seeking-safety)

        1.1 Accessibility: The chart's colors may be problematic for color-blind users, as color choices and contrasts might hinder differentiation. This affects accessibility for those with color vision deficiencies.

        1.2 Reproducibility: 
        
        Data and Methods: The chart lacks details on data sources and methods, making replication difficult. Transparency is essential for reproducibility, which is not provided here.

        1.3 Equity: 
        
        Data Presentation: While the chart shows safety and migration data, without details on data selection or biases, it's unclear if it is equitable. Transparency in data handling is crucial.

      2. Bad Visualization: Foreigners in Milan

        2.1 Accessibility:

        Color: The chart uses a red color gradient, which may be hard for color-blind users to differentiate. This could impact clarity for those with color vision deficiencies.

        Text: The chart has a large amount of text, which might be overwhelming and hard to read. This could affect accessibility, particularly for users with visual impairments.

        2.2 Reproducibility:

        Data and Methods: The chart lacks details on data sources and methods, making it challenging to replicate the results. Transparency is essential for reproducibility.

        2.3 Equity:

        Data Presentation: The chart shows various data but lacks information on data selection and biases. This makes it difficult to assess if the representation is equitable.

        ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved (in terms of accessibility, reproducibility, equity)?  
        ```
      1. Good Visualization:

        1.1 Accessibility:

        Color: Use distinguishable color palettes such as Viridis to accommodate color-blind users. Ensure sufficient color contrast for better visibility and readability.

        Text: Use a font size of at least 12 points and provide simple alt-text for screen readers. Ensure that the text is clear and readable across different devices and resolutions.

        1.2 Reproducibility:

        Data and Methods: Provide detailed information on data sources, processing methods, and visualization techniques. Share the visualization code (e.g., R or Python scripts) to enable others to accurately replicate the results.
        
        1.3 Equity:

        Data Presentation: Clearly explain data selection criteria and any potential biases. Ensure that the data presentation is fair to all relevant groups and avoids misleading or biased representation.

      2. Bad Visualization:
    
        2.1 Accessibility:

        Color: Use color palettes that are friendly for color-blind users, avoiding single-color gradients. Ensure high color contrast to enhance readability.

        Text: Limit the amount of text on the chart and ensure that font size is appropriate for readability. Provide alt-text for screen readers to convey the chartâ€™s content effectively.

        2.2 Reproducibility:

        Data and Methods: Clearly specify data sources and methods used in the visualization. Provide detailed information or code to allow others to replicate the results accurately.

        2.3 Equity:

        Data Presentation: Offer transparency about data selection and processing. Ensure the data representation is equitable and reflects all relevant perspectives without introducing bias.

        ```

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 300 words for each visualization. 

### Why am I doing this assignment?:
